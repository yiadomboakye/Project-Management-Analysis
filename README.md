# Financial Project Analysis

### Project Overview

This project focuses on organizing workforce and financial data to develop a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into employee performance, financial risks, and project health. The dashboard will help the organization identify departments and projects that are at risk of being over budget or underperforming, allowing for timely corrective actions. Additionally, it will analyse departmental expenses over a two-year interval to determine if budgets can sufficiently cover all expenses.

### Data Sources
The dataset for this project was obtained from the AbsentData website. The data consists of CSV files, which were used to create a database. Queries were written and then imported into Power BI for analysis.
